Allow your registered members to submit, edit and delete posts from the frontend.

== Description ==

This lightweight plugin allows you to accept guest posts/articles without giving your members access to the sensitive WordPress control panel. It will automatically filter out all the posts that don't meet the submission guidelines of your website. It can be a huge time saver if you have a very popular blog or article directory.

In the backend control panel you can specify the following:

*   maximum and minimum number of words in title, content and author bio
*   number of tags
*   number of links in article body and author bio
*   whether you want to nofollow the links in article body and/or author bio

You can allow members with a certain user level to publish posts instantly. All other posts are added to the 'pending' queue. 

Simply use the shortcodes [fep_submission_form] and [fep_article_list] to get started (But DO NOT add the two codes on the same post or page)

== Installation ==

1. Use the WordPress plugin installer to upload the plugin. Alternatively you can manually create a new folder called 'fepublishing' in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and upload all the files there.
2. Activate the plugin from the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. To display the submission form on your website create a new post or page with shortcode [fep_submission_form] in it
4. Similarly create a new post or page with shortcode [fep_article_list]
